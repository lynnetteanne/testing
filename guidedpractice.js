// You were hired by a global hotel chain to redesign the functionality of the 
// button panel on their elevators. The goal is to replace the outdated panel 
// in over 1,200 different locations. Before you begin coding, you should make 
// a list of all the ways these panels should be tested to make sure they are 
// working correctly and respond to unexpected input in a way that makes sense. 
// Remember to consider happy and unhappy paths! 

// To complete this guided practice, write as many Unit Tests as possible. If 
// time allows, write at least one integration, functional, and acceptance test. 
// Be sure to label each test with its associated type (Unit, Integration, 
// Functional, Acceptance).  

//unit
// push close door and the doors close
// push open door and the doors open
// push floor number and the button illuminates

// //integration
// pushing a floor number closes the doors and goes to that floor

// //functional
// push outside button, doors open, push floor number, it lights up, doors close, elevator goes to that floor

//acceptance
